# CSV Explorer (Streamlit App)

This repository contains a small **CSV explorer** built with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/).

It lets you:

- Upload a CSV file from your computer
- Inspect and filter the data
- Build interactive plots (using Plotly)
- Explore the dataset directly in your browser

All data stays **local on your machine**. The app runs on your computer and opens in your web browser.
